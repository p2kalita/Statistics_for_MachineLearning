## About The Project

Here are some statistics concepts that are important in machine learning:
1. Mean: It is the average value of a set of numbers. In machine learning, mean is often used to represent the average of a target variable in a dataset.

2. Median: It is the middle value of a set of numbers when they are arranged in order. In machine learning, median is used to represent the central tendency of a target variable in a dataset when the data is skewed or has outliers.

3. Mode: It is the most frequent value in a set of numbers. In machine learning, mode is used to represent the most frequent class or value of a target variable in a dataset.

4. Variance: It is a measure of how far each number in a set is from the mean. In machine learning, variance is used to represent the spread of the data and to calculate the standard deviation.

5. Standard Deviation: It is the square root of the variance and represents the average distance of each number from the mean. In machine learning, standard deviation is used to represent the variability of the data.

6. Correlation: It is a statistical measure that represents the linear relationship between two variables. In machine learning, correlation is used to identify the relationship between features and the target variable, and to select features for building models.

7. Covariance: It is a measure of the joint variability between two variables. In machine learning, covariance is used to calculate the correlation between two variables.

These are some of the basic statistics concepts that are important in machine learning. Understanding these concepts is crucial for selecting appropriate algorithms and building accurate models.
